# Awake-Wheel

This is the Year 3 project I had to carry out at ESILV, the specifications required us to create a drowsiness detection application for drivers.

small disclaimer I didn't have the time to translate my comments into English sorry :(

I used this dataset to train the AI : https://universe.roboflow.com/jeja-jaya-jaya-jaya/expression-recognition/dataset/2

As the model is too large, you will need to reuse the TrainingAI.py file to recover the model.keras.
Once you have the model, all you have to do is run the exec.py file, which creates a local server using the Flask library.
Finally, you just need to run the application using android studio.
